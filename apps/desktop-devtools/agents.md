# desktop-devtools — Agent Instructions

> **Read root `agents.md` FIRST**, then this file.  
> **Last Updated:** 2026-03-11 (Switched to dx build; removed dx serve --hotpatch)

## Purpose

`desktop-devtools` is a **special build of the Poly desktop app** with an
embedded HTTP eval-bridge server on port 9223. It renders the full Poly UI
(setup wizard, main layout, etc.) in a Wry/WebKit webview while exposing
inspection endpoints that the MCP server (`poly-desktop-devtools-mcp`) calls.

**This is NOT an MCP server itself** — it is the app being inspected.
The MCP server lives in `crates/poly-desktop-devtools-mcp/`.

---

## MCP and App Isolation (IMPORTANT)

**As of 2026-03-01:** The MCP and the desktop app are now **decoupled**.

- The MCP runs in its **own background process** with dedicated terminal
- Calling `kill_app()` from the MCP **does NOT kill the MCP itself**
- This allows hot-reload: kill + relaunch the app while MCP stays connected

**Pattern:** Use pattern `"poly-desktop-devtools($|[^-])"` in pkill to match the
app binary but exclude the `-mcp` variant. This ensures only the UI app dies,
not the MCP server.

## Screenshot Implementation

**Uses `webkit2gtk::WebViewExt::snapshot()`** — the native WebKit capture API.

**IMPORTANT: GDK pixbuf does NOT work** for WebKit content. GDK captures the
window chrome, but WebKit renders via GPU acceleration — the captured area is
blank/white. Always use the webkit2gtk snapshot approach.

Pattern:
1. `SCREENSHOT_TX/RX` channels — same pattern as eval bridge
2. `DevtoolsShell` runs `use_coroutine` that holds the webkit2gtk `WebView` handle
3. Callback-based API: `wv.snapshot(region, options, cancellable, callback)`
4. Callback fires on GLib main thread with `cairo::Surface`
5. `Surface::write_to_png()` encodes to PNG bytes in a `Vec<u8>`
6. Results polled via `std::sync::mpsc` + 16ms sleep ticks (yields to GLib loop)

Dependencies needed:
- `webkit2gtk = "2.0"` — snapshot API + gio + glib
- `cairo-rs = { version = "0.18", features = ["png"] }` — PNG encoding
- `wry = "0.53"` — `WebViewExtUnix::webview()` to get the underlying `webkit2gtk::WebView`

Correct imports (webkit2gtk 2.0 has no `prelude` module):
```rust
use webkit2gtk::WebViewExt as _;  // brings snapshot() into scope
// cairo::Surface — from the cairo-rs crate (imported as `cairo`)
// webkit2gtk::SnapshotRegion, SnapshotOptions — re-exported from crate root
// webkit2gtk::gio::Cancellable::NONE — for optional cancellable parameter
```

## Eval Bridge Pattern (Restart-Safe)

The eval bridge uses a **recreatable channel** pattern so it survives kill-and-relaunch cycles:

1. `EVAL_TX` / `SCREENSHOT_TX` — `std::sync::Mutex<Option<mpsc::Sender>>` (NOT `OnceLock`)
2. On each app launch / `DevtoolsShell` mount, fresh `mpsc` channels are created and the sender is stored in the global mutex
3. Each `EvalRequest` contains `js: String` + `oneshot::Sender<Result<String, String>>`
4. The coroutine calls `eval(&req.js).await` and sends the result back
5. HTTP handlers call `do_eval(js)` which clones the current sender from the mutex
6. HTTP server binds :9223 once (guarded by `AtomicBool`), survives component remounts

**Why not `OnceLock`?** `OnceLock` can only be set once per process. If the component tree remounts for any reason, the old receiver is dropped but `OnceLock` prevents creating new channels — the eval bridge dies permanently.

### Dioxus eval() Semantics

Scripts are wrapped as: `(new AsyncFunction("dioxus", SCRIPT))(dioxus)`

This means:
- Bare expressions like `document.title` do NOT return a value
- Must use `return document.title` explicitly
- `do_eval()` auto-prefixes `return` and strips trailing `;` for convenience

## `/generation` Endpoint — Rebuild Detection

`GET /generation` returns a JSON object with three fields for detecting rebuild cycles:

```json
{ "generation": 1, "build_id": 3, "pid": 2890763 }
```

**All three fields are always included in every response** — they're returned together in one JSON object.

| Field | Reset condition | Increments on |
|---|---|---|
| `generation` | Process restart (→1) | `DevtoolsShell` component FULLY unmounts + remounts |
| `build_id` | System reboot / file deleted | Every `rebuild_app` MCP call — the MCP writes `/tmp/poly-devtools-rebuild-counter` |
| `pid` | Never resets (OS assigns) | Process restart only |

### ⭐ **ALWAYS USE `build_id` TO DETECT REBUILDS — Check All Three Together**

**`build_id` is the universal rebuild indicator.** To verify **nothing changed**, all three fields must be identical from the previous poll:

| `generation` | `build_id` | `pid` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Same** | **Same** | **Same** | ✅ No changes (no rebuild, no hot-patch, no process restart) |
| Changed | Same | Same | 🔨 Hot-patch occurred (window alive, component remounted — rare) |
| **Changed** | **Changed** | **Same** | 🔨 **Rebuild triggered** (most common case — window stayed alive) |
| Changed | Changed | Changed | 🔄 Full process restart |
| Any changed | **Any changed** | Any changed | ⚠️ **Something changed** — `build_id` specifically indicates rebuild |

**For visual/screenshot testing:** After each rebuild, verify that `build_id` increased from the previous poll.  
**Do NOT rely on `generation` alone** — it may not change even if a rebuild was triggered (component state preserved by hot-patch).

**Always check all three to verify no changes occurred** — if all three values match the previous poll, then nothing happened.

### Why `build_id` not `generation`

`use_coroutine` hook state may be preserved across some component remounts. This means:

- `GENERATION` atomically increments **only when `DevtoolsShell` fully unmounts + remounts**
- For some structural Dioxus changes, the component may skip a full unmount → `generation` stays the same
- **`generation` is unreliable for rebuild detection** — use `build_id` instead

### `build_id` — Counter File Approach

The counter file (`/tmp/poly-devtools-rebuild-counter`) is **incremented by the MCP** on
each `rebuild_app` call, and **read at runtime by the app** on each `/generation` request.

---

## Build Approach (DECISION, 2026-03-11)

**The desktop MCP uses `dx build --platform desktop` — never `dx serve --hotpatch`.**

Each `rebuild_app` / `launch_app` call:
1. Kills the running binary (pkill MCP-safe pattern)
2. Runs `dx build --platform desktop` (blocking, synchronous, immediate exit code)
3. Launches the new binary and waits for the eval bridge on port 9223

**Advantages:**
- Immediate pass/fail feedback from exit code — no polling
- No dx serve process to manage
- No stale port issues
- Build errors appear in `get_last_build_log` immediately after the call returns

---



**MUST use `dx build --platform desktop`** — NOT `cargo build`.

The `asset!()` macro in poly-core inserts a placeholder path. Only the dx
linker resolves it to the actual hashed filename. Running `cargo build` leaves
the placeholder intact → CSS never loads.

```bash
cd apps/desktop-devtools && dx build --platform desktop
```

Output: `target/dx/poly-desktop-devtools/debug/linux/app/poly-desktop-devtools`

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/main.rs` | Entry point, eval bridge, HTTP server, DevtoolsShell component |
| `Cargo.toml` | Dependencies (dioxus desktop, axum, poly-core with demo feature) |
| `Dioxus.toml` | dx build config (1440×900, desktop platform) |

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION — `#[allow(...)]` is FORBIDDEN

**NEVER** add `#[allow(clippy::...)]`, `#[allow(warnings)]`, or any other lint suppression
attribute to source code. When `cargo cranky` reports a violation, **fix the code**.

**The ONLY exception**: inside `#[cfg(test)]` modules, `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]`
and `#[allow(clippy::expect_used)]` are permitted for test assertions — nothing else.

See root `agents.md` § 7a for the full rationale.
