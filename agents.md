- **Type:** Cross-platform, multi-backend messenger client
- **Language:** Rust (latest stable)
- **UI Framework:** Dioxus 0.7.3
- **Database:** SurrealDB 3.0.x (SurrealKV backend EVERYWHERE — desktop + mobile)
- **License:** MIT / Apache-2.0 dual license

---

## MANDATORY RULES — READ EVERY SESSION

### 1. Version Constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Dependency | Version | Documentation Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Rust** | Latest stable (`rustup update stable`) | https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/ |
| **Dioxus** | **0.7.3** | https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/releases/tag/v0.7.3 and https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.7/ |
| **SurrealDB** | **3.0.x** | https://surrealdb.com/3.0 — ONLY use 3.0 documentation. Do NOT reference 2.x or 1.x docs. |
| **Tokio** | Latest (multi-threaded runtime, implied by Dioxus) | |

**DO NOT** use outdated API patterns from older Dioxus (0.4, 0.5, 0.6) or SurrealDB (1.x, 2.x) versions.

### 2. Crate Update Policy

- **Always use latest stable versions** of all Rust crates
- Check `last-crate-update-date` in the workspace root at the START of every session
- If the date is **older than 3 months**, run `cargo update` and update all workspace dependencies
- After updating, update the date in `last-crate-update-date`
- When adding a new crate, use the latest version from crates.io

### 3. Hot Reload — CRITICAL

- **poly-core** is the shared library crate where most development happens
- It **MUST** support Dioxus subsecond hot-reload via `dx serve --hotpatch`
- Use `subsecond::call()` patterns where needed
- **Test hot-reload after any structural changes to poly-core**
- If hot-reload breaks, fixing it is the #1 priority above all other work

### 4. Workspace Structure

- **Cargo workspace** with `[workspace.dependencies]` for shared dependency versions
- **Every crate, app, client, server, and MCP project (anything with a `Cargo.toml`) MUST have its own `agents.md`**
- **Read the crate's `agents.md` before working on that crate** — it contains crate-specific rules, constraints, and architectural decisions
- **Update the crate's `agents.md`** when you make architectural decisions or learn something important
- Use agent.md and README.md files as **eidetic memory** — document everything
- Each crate has its own `README.md`

### 5. Feature Flags

Messenger backends are feature-flagged in `poly-core`:
- `stoat` — Stoat (Revolt) client
- `matrix` — Matrix client
- `discord` — Discord client
- `teams` — Microsoft Teams client
- `demo` — Demo/mock client for testing

Someone should be able to build Poly with only `discord + teams` or any other combination.

### 6. i18n — ALL strings through translations

- **Every user-facing string** must go through the i18n system
- Use `.ftl` (Project Fluent) files in `locales/`
- Never hardcode English strings in UI components
- Languages: English (default), German, French, Spanish
- Fallback: user locale → `en`

### 7. Code Quality

- Run `cargo cranky --workspace` — zero warnings/errors policy (uses `cranky.toml` in each crate)
  - `cranky` is a `cargo clippy` wrapper that reads `cranky.toml` for denied/warned lints
  - Every crate and the workspace root has a `cranky.toml` denying: `warnings`, `unsafe_code`, `clippy::unwrap_used`, `clippy::expect_used`, `clippy::panic`, `clippy::indexing_slicing`, `clippy::print_stdout`, `clippy::print_stderr`
  - Install once: `cargo install cranky`
- Run `cargo check --workspace` — verify all crates compile
- **After any change to `poly-core` or `poly-web`**: run the VS Code task **"Check: poly-web (WASM)"** (or `cargo check -p poly-web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`) to verify WASM compatibility. The desktop build does NOT catch WASM-only breakage.
- Run `cargo fmt --all` — consistent formatting
- Write doc comments on all public items
- Write `// TODO(phase-X.Y.Z):` comments referencing the plan item number
- Add `// DECISION(DX):` comments referencing decision numbers from overall-plan.md

### 7a. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION — `#[allow(...)]` is FORBIDDEN

**NEVER** add `#[allow(clippy::...)]`, `#[allow(warnings)]`, or any other lint suppression attribute to source code.

This applies to **all** Clippy lints in every `cranky.toml`:
- `warnings = true` — all compiler warnings are errors
- `unsafe_code`
- `clippy::unwrap_used`
- `clippy::expect_used`
- `clippy::panic`
- `clippy::indexing_slicing`
- `clippy::print_stdout` / `clippy::print_stderr`

When `cargo cranky` reports a lint violation, **FIX THE CODE**. Never suppress it with an allow attribute.

**The ONLY exception** — inside `#[cfg(test)]` modules:
- `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` is permitted for test assertions (e.g. `result.unwrap()`)
- `#[allow(clippy::expect_used)]` is permitted for test setup (e.g. `val.expect("test context")`)
- No other allows are permitted even in tests

Rationale: these rules exist to prevent real bugs. Suppressing them hides the problem. Smaller models
try to `#[allow(...)]` their way out of lint errors — this is explicitly prohibited in this project.

### 7b. CRITICAL — RSX Macros + `cargo fmt` Incompatibility (DECISION, 2026-03-08)

**THE PROBLEM:** `cargo fmt` corrupts Dioxus RSX macros when closures span multiple lines.
It generates invalid Rust syntax like duplicated if/else branches or malformed field assignments.
Example breakage:
```rust
// Before fmt: correct
onchange: move |e: Event<FormData>| {
    let val = e.value();
    chat_data.write().voice_media_settings.mic_device_id = if val.is_empty() { None } else { Some(val) };
},

// After fmt: BROKEN — duplicated conditional logic
onchange: move |e: Event<FormData>| {
    let val = e.value();
    chat_data.write().voice_media_settings.mic_device_id =
        if val.is_empty() { None } else { Some(val) };
        None    // <-- CORRUPTED: duplicated/unreachable
    } else {
        Some(val)
    };  // <-- Syntax error: unmatched brace
},
```

**THE SOLUTION:** Add `#[rustfmt::skip]` immediately before **every** `#[component]` attribute.

```rust
#[rustfmt::skip]  // <- REQUIRED: prevents fmt from mangling RSX
#[component]      // <- Always pair with rustfmt::skip
fn MyComponent() -> Element {
    rsx! { /* ... */ }
}
```

**REQUIREMENT:** When you write a new `#[component]` function OR encounter an existing one without the attribute:
1. Add `#[rustfmt::skip]` on the line immediately **before** `#[component]`
2. Save the file — fmt MUST NOT corrupt it
3. If fmt still corrupts it, the component RSX is too complex and needs to be refactored into smaller subcomponents

**STATUS:** ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS** — As of 2026-03-08, not all existing components have this attribute yet.
This is the source of recurring "saving breaks the code" incidents.

### 8. Documentation Protocol

When making architectural decisions:
1. Document in the relevant crate's `agents.md`
2. If project-wide, also add to `docs/overall-plan.md` Decision Registry
3. Update the relevant phase plan checklist
4. Write code comments explaining non-obvious choices

### 9. poly-core Changes — MANDATORY DevTools Visual Verification

**Every time you make changes to `poly-core` (or `crates/core`) you MUST verify the changes work correctly using the Desktop DevTools MCP.** This is non-negotiable — code that compiles but renders broken UI is a bug.

**Required verification steps after ANY change to poly-core:**

1. `cargo check --workspace` — must be error-free
2. `cargo cranky --workspace` — must be zero warnings/errors
3. `cargo check -p poly-web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` — verify WASM compat
4. `dx build --platform desktop` in `apps/desktop-devtools/` — full build must succeed
5. Launch the app via `mcp_poly-desktop_launch_app`
6. Connect via `mcp_poly-desktop_connect_cdp`
7. Take screenshots via `mcp_poly-desktop_screenshot` and verify:
   - Enable demo data (click the 🧪 toggle)
   - Navigate to affected views/components
   - Confirm UI renders correctly with no missing elements
   - Test interactive elements (buttons, pickers, navigation)
8. Document any visual issues found and fix before declaring done

**Why this rule exists:** RSX macro syntax errors produce misleading Rust error messages. A build that passes `cargo check` may still have component logic bugs that only appear visually. The DevTools MCP is the ground truth for "does the UI work".

### 9a. DevTools MCP Rebuild Detection — `build_id` (DECISION, 2026-03-03)

Both desktop and web MCPs expose `/generation` endpoints that return a JSON object with three fields:

```json
{ "generation": 3, "build_id": 2, "pid": 2890763 }  // desktop
{ "generation": 4, "build_id": 2, "dx_serve_pid": 2898097 }  // web
```

**All three fields are always included in every response.** Use `build_id` to know if a rebuild was triggered.

| MCP | Endpoint | Counter File | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Desktop** | via `poly-desktop-devtools-mcp` | `/tmp/poly-devtools-rebuild-counter` | `generation` may NOT change on hot-patches (state preserved) |
| **Web** | via `poly-web-devtools-mcp` | `/tmp/poly-devtools-web-rebuild-counter` | `generation` increments on EVERY `connect_cdp` (page reload) |

### ⭐ Complete Decision Table — Check All Three

To verify **nothing changed**, all three must be identical from the previous poll:

**Desktop:**

| `generation` | `build_id` | `pid` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Same** | **Same** | **Same** | ✅ No changes |
| Any | **Changed** | Any | 🔨 Rebuild triggered |
| Changed | Same | Same | Hot-patch |
| Changed | Changed | Changed | Process restart |

**Web:**

| `generation` | `build_id` | `dx_serve_pid` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Same** | **Same** | **Same** | ✅ No changes |
| Changed | **Changed** | Same | 🔨 **Rebuild + reconnect succeeded** |
| Changed | Changed | Changed | `dx serve` restarted |

**Key rule:** 
- **If all three fields are identical to the previous poll, nothing changed**
- **If `build_id` changed, a rebuild was triggered** (most reliable indicator)
- Use for visual/screenshot testing: poll `get_generation()`, compare all three fields to previous state

See `mcp/desktop-devtools-mcp/agents.md` and `mcp/web-devtools-mcp/agents.md` for platform-specific details.

### 9b. Dioxus Rebuild Toast Is NOT Ground Truth (DECISION, 2026-03-08)

Dioxus may temporarily inject a visible overlay/toast such as **"Your app is being rebuilt"**
during hot-reload / hotpatch cycles.

**Do NOT treat that text as authoritative app state.** It is only a transient UI artifact from
the Dioxus dev runtime and may briefly remain visible even after the app underneath has already
updated successfully.

For all agent-driven visual verification and MCP automation:

1. **Never** use the rebuild toast text as the success/failure signal.
2. **Never** conclude the app is stuck solely because a screenshot or snapshot contains that text.
3. Use the MCP rebuild counters instead:
  - Desktop: compare `generation`, `build_id`, and `pid`
  - Web: compare `generation`, `build_id`, and `dx_serve_pid`
  - Electron: compare `generation`, `build_id`, and `electron_pid`
4. Prefer this readiness order:
  - confirm `build_id` changed if a rebuild was requested
  - reconnect if required (`connect_cdp` for web/electron)
  - take a fresh DOM snapshot / screenshot
  - verify expected app UI markers (real route text, buttons, inputs, message list, etc.)
5. Avoid `wait_for(...)` using rebuild-toast strings; wait for stable app-specific content instead.

**Rule of thumb:** the rebuild toast is a hint that recompilation happened, not proof that the app
is broken.

**DOM element behavior:** The overlay/toast element may persist in the DOM or remain visible in snapshots
even after the app underneath has already updated successfully. Do not conclude the build failed or the app
is stuck solely because you see the rebuild-toast text in a DOM snapshot or screenshot.

At the START of each coding session:
1. Read this `agents.md`
2. Read `last-crate-update-date` — update crates if >3 months old
3. Read the relevant phase plan to know what to work on next
4. Read the `agents.md` of the crate(s) you'll work on
5. Check `docs/overall-plan.md` for any open decisions

At the END of each session:
1. Run `cargo cranky --workspace` — fix ALL lint errors before committing
2. Run `cargo fmt --all` — format all code
3. Update phase plan checkboxes for completed items
4. Update relevant `agents.md` files with new learnings
5. Write a brief session summary in the phase plan (append to bottom)

### 10. Platform Targets

| App | Renderer | Entry Point |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop Wry | System webview (Wry) | `apps/desktop/` |
| Desktop Blitz | WGPU native (experimental) | `apps/desktop-blitz/` |
| Desktop Electron | WASM in Electron shell | `apps/desktop-electron/` |
| Android | Dioxus mobile | `apps/android/` |
| iOS | Dioxus mobile | `apps/ios/` |
| Web | Dioxus fullstack + Axum | `apps/web/` |
| Backup Server | Axum + Dioxus fullstack | `servers/backup-server/` |

### 11. Database Engine

**SurrealKV everywhere.** No RocksDB. No SQLite. No divergence between platforms.
- Feature: `kv-surrealkv` on the `surrealdb` crate
- If SurrealKV fails to compile on a mobile target, that's a P0 blocker to resolve

### 11a. Client Plugin WASM Boundary — WIT Component Model, NOT `wasm-bindgen` (DECISION, 2026-03-08)

Poly's **client plugins** do **not** use the typical Rust↔JS `wasm-bindgen` boundary described in many Wasm blog posts.
They compile as **WASM Component Model** plugins targeting `wasm32-wasip2`, with the ABI defined in
`wit/messenger-plugin.wit`, generated guest bindings via `wit-bindgen`, and host bindings via
`wasmtime::component::bindgen!`.

This means the Brooklyn Zelenka-style guidance about:
- passing exported objects by `&reference`
- `Rc<RefCell<T>>` / `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for JS-visible handles
- avoiding `Copy` on exported wrapper types
- `wasm_refgen` for `Vec<WasmFoo>`-style collections
- `Wasm*` / `Js*` naming for `wasm-bindgen`
- `From<Error> for JsValue` with `js_sys::Error`

is **mostly NOT the governing rule set for Poly client plugins**, because our boundary is **typed WIT values**, not
JS object handles.

**Rules for Poly client plugins instead:**
1. Model the plugin ABI in **WIT** using records, variants, enums, options, lists, tuples, and `result<_, client-error>`.
2. Treat the boundary as **value-based**. Do **not** design the plugin ABI around Rust borrows/references crossing the boundary.
3. Do **not** introduce `wasm-bindgen`, `JsValue`, `js_sys::Error`, `extern "C"`, `js_name`, or `js_class` into the client-plugin ABI.
4. Keep boundary types **flat, serializable, and Component-Model-friendly**. If a type is awkward to express in WIT, redesign the boundary.
5. Use the shared typed error channel: WIT `client-error` ↔ `poly-client::ClientError` via guest/host bridge code.
6. When changing any client-facing shared type, update **all four layers** together:
  - `clients/client/src/*`
  - `wit/messenger-plugin.wit`
  - `clients/*/src/guest.rs`
  - `crates/plugin-host/src/bridge.rs`
7. Validate boundary changes by rebuilding the affected plugins and running `poly-plugin-loader-tests`.

`wasm-bindgen` advice may still be relevant for **separate browser/JS interop code**, but **not** for the Poly client-plugin boundary.

### 12. Research Resources

When implementing messenger backends, consult:
- **Stoat (Revolt):** `developers.stoat.chat` API docs, Revolt backend source (GitHub)
- **Matrix:** `matrix-sdk` docs on docs.rs, Matrix spec at spec.matrix.org
- **Discord:** Research carefully — TOS prohibits unofficial clients. Check for new developments.
- **Teams:** `ttyms` crate source code, Microsoft Graph API docs
- **WebRTC:** `webrtc` crate docs, look up platform-specific native bindings for camera/mic
- **Voice/Video on mobile:** Research Flutter packages with native bindings that could help, also native Rust bindings

### 13. Theme System

- CSS custom properties for all colors
- 3 built-in presets: neutral-dark (default), purple (Discord), red (Stoat)
- Full per-color customization + custom CSS editor
- Theme import/export (share CSS files)
- Dark mode default, light mode optional, follow-device-preference option

### 14. Security

- Local DB: account tokens may be stored unencrypted (acceptable)
- Backup server: ALL data encrypted BEFORE leaving device — NEVER send plaintext
- Identity: Ed25519 keypair, X25519 derived, BIP39 mnemonic recovery phrase
- Backup auth: PoW challenge + server-wide passphrase + long session tokens with device tracking

### 15. Git Workflow — NEVER COMMIT OR PUSH WITHOUT USER REVIEW

- **NEVER** run `git commit` or `git push` without the user explicitly reviewing and approving the changes first
- You MAY use `git add` / `git stage` and the staging area freely — this helps with diffs and tracking
- You MAY use `git diff`, `git log`, `git show`, `git stash`, `git checkout` to inspect history, compare versions, or recover older code
- Before committing: tell the user what changed and wait for their go-ahead
- Exception: if the user explicitly says "commit this" or "commit and push", then proceed
- Never force-push (`git push --force`) under any circumstances without explicit user consent
